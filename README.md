## Description
This project is built using **TypeScript** with **React**. It leverages **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds, **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling, and **ShadCN** for consistent and modern UI components.

## Features
- **Fast Development with Vite**: Instant hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized builds.
- **TypeScript Support**: Ensures type safety and better developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS for Styling**: Provides a flexible and maintainable styling approach.
- **ShadCN Components**: Pre-styled and customizable components for a polished UI.
- **Optimized Production Builds**: Efficient bundling for better performance.

## Installation
To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Development
To start the development server, run:
```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
This will start the **Vite development server**, and the application will be available in your browser.
